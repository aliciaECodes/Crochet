          <h2>What does it mean to Crochet?</h2>
          <p>
            Crochet is a process of creating textiles by usng a crochet hook to
            interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The
            name is derived from the French term
            <em>crochet</em>, meaning 'small hook'. Hooks can be made from a
            variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic.

          <h2>What do you need to Crochet?</h2>
          <p>
            Basic materials required for crochet are a hook and some type of
            material that will be crocheted, most commonly yarn or thread. Yarn,
            one of the most commonly used materials for crocheting, has varying

            patterns.

          <h2>What are the health benefits?</h2>
          <p>
            Crocheting and other forms of needlecraft or handicraft are proven
            to have several health benefits including reducing stress and
            anxiety. Studies show that the constant repetition of hand movement
            helps keep the mind calm and distracts the brain from the stresses
            of life.
